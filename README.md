# Yendou Project - Code Review Repository 🛠️

Welcome to the **Yendou** repository! This is a platform where you can check the counter application built with modern frontend technologies. It allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter while displaying real-time updates through a customized toast notification system.

## Overview

The Yendou repository is a guide for building scalable and maintainable React applications. It provides a set of best practices, patterns, and principles for structuring your code. While the suggested tools and libraries reflect modern standards, you’re free to adapt them to fit your project’s needs. The aim is to help developers create high-quality React apps, improve their skills, and foster collaboration through contributions.

The purpose of this repository is to:

- **Review code quality** and **project structure**.
- Help developers **apply best practices** in React development.
- Provide a space for receiving **feedback on code standards** and **design patterns**.
- Allow contributions through **Pull Requests**, whether for suggestions, improvements, or fixes.

By working with this repository, you can enhance your skills in building scalable React applications and learn how to work effectively with modern development tools.
